# Connect 4

## About

> Connect 4 is a Mario Themed application based on the classic board game Connect 4. Two players take alternating turns attempting to be the first person to match four of their pieces in row in either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal orientation. The active player will select one of six columns to place their game piece in, and the game piece will fall in the last available row.
